# Restaurant Website - Sushi Chef K 

[LIVE DEMO](https://dianaleo.github.io/Sushi_Chef_K/)

This project is a demonstration website for a small business - Sushi Chef K. It includes home, menu, testimonials, about us and find us pages. 
Through this project, my knowledge of HTML, CSS, SASS, and JS was consolidated. And I also learned a lot about **file and folder structure, SASS features, responsive design, and debugging on mobile devices.**

 - The layout and color scheme are designed according to their logo and menu.

 - **The responsive design has been made for PC, ipad, and mobile phones.**

 - Tech stack: HTML, SASS, and Javascript

 - Currently, it contains static pages. No database involved. In the future, reservation and order system will be added hopefully.

# Restaurant Website - Sushi Chef K 

[LIVE DEMO](https://dianaleo.github.io/Sushi_Chef_K/)

This project is a demonstration website for a small business, including home, menu, testimonials, about us and find us pages. 

 - I designed the layout and color scheme according to their logo and menu.

 - **The responsive design has been made for PC, ipad, and mobile phones.**

 - Currently, it contains static pages. No database involved. In the future, reservation and order system will be added hopefully.
